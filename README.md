# Mercury

Tried my hands on writing kernel drivers. I tried building a character driver module.

But as most personal projects, I started it off with great passion, but when I came to know the semantics and procedure of building a device driver, I thought 'what a drag'. If anyone wants to contribute, please go ahead. Although, I must warn you, driver devlopment requires a lot more than application development skills.
